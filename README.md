The Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor Website
=====================================================

This is the source repository for the BOOM processor website.

### Making changes to the website

Basic configuration changes can be made in the `_config.yml` file. This includes changes to the navigation bar, website colors, and more.

All main pages are implemented as `.md` files in the root directory while images are in the `img` directory.

For more information on how to make changes to the website, refer to the original website template repository located at [https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).
